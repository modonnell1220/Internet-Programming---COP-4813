# Internet-Programming---COP-4813

These are the files of the assignments I had done for my Internet Programming Class Fall 2016 at UNF.
During the time, they were uploaded to a school server and were viewable through a browser under the 
server url containing the address followed by my school number. As of now, this no longer works but 
the code for each project is here, along with descriptions of the project in the main index file.
