                <h3><a href="assign1/index.html">Assignment 1</a></h3>               
                <p>This first assignment was done to create this current eportfolio page, along with an About Me page, and to have a CSS extension linked to both this portfolio and the About Me page. By doing this, I learned the basics and some more advanced topics from HTML and CSS, such as headings, paragraphs, body and head tags, links, tables, and how to format and use all of these with their respective attributes. This assignment also taught me how to go about setting up and using a CSS page to edit and change the way the page will look by simply using the tags in the css extension and keep everything formatted consistently thorught my eportfolio, such as font, background, colors, links and the formatting scheme for any tables.</p>
                Learning Objectives:
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML: body and head tags, headings and paragraphs</li>
                    <li>HTML: tables, rows and columns</li>
                    <li>HTML: links, including rollever effects</li>
                    <li>CSS: formatting fonts, background, colors, rollover effects, links, pictures, and paragraphs</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="assign2/index.html">Assignment 2</a></h3>
                <p>This second assignment was about programming on client-side using javascript. The goal was to create a form page which would be filled out by the user and then submitted. Upon submission, a function would be called in javascript which would take the information provided and perform through a series of statements with the info given to come to some result and provide the user with said result. A flowchart will be incorporated in order to logically layout how the logic will flow before writing the program in the function to work with the information. I learned quite the amount, focusing on javascript and forms. I also had the chance to review over creating flowcharts, which I had not done in a couple years.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML: Creating forms, working with text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, submit, and reset</li>
                    <li>Javascript: Programming functions, variable handling, and if-else-then statements</li>
                    <li>Flowcharts: Review proper flowchart creation, and use to layout logic of program's function</li>
                </ul>
            </td>

        <tr>
            <td>
                <h3><a href="assign3/index.html">Assignment 3</a></h3>
                <p>Assignment Three was based around working with multiple functions sourced in another file that we refer to in order to get the functions we need to perform statistics. The thing about this was that the fucntions contained similar traits in that they would need informarion that other functions provided, so calling them from within would be necessary. One aspect of this was working with loops, both wile and for loops. Because I am a computer scientist, this was very easy for me to do, having plenty of experience in it. So the project came down to really making sure the formulas I program gave out the correct responses and answers, otherwise it wouldn't work correctly for other functions that needed that information.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML: More work with forms and formatting them</li>
                    <li>Javascript: Sourcing another file outside of our index.html</li>
                    <li>Javascript: Functions containing for and while loops, and calling functions from within another</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="assign4/index.html">Assignment 4</a></h3>
                <p>This assignment was different from the others. This asked for one thing only, an animation of some concept, which we choose, and it must meet certain requirements. This turned out to be somewhat more tedious then I had expected. Using jQuery frameworks, I was able to make sure this assignment wouldn't be too difficult since I found them easier to be used. Formatting of the objects, along with timing and motion and changing the arrows were quite annpying to have to work with but it wasn't too bad in the end. Once I understood how to get the positioning of the movement effect down, along with the css and html changing syntax understood, it became more of tedious process at the end to make sure it was all correct.</p>
                <ul>

                <h3><a href="assign5/index.php">Assignment 5</a></h3>
                <p>The project was much more difficult then the previous assignments, or perhaps it was the time consuming nature of it misinterpreted into the illusion of difficult. Anyway, the assignment required that I create a login page into a stock manager portfolio, which creates a session for the user that logs in. Once they log in with the correct username and password, they are able to add, modify, delete stocks on their portfolio account. The stocks on their account, shares, time and dates added are presented a the bottom of the page in a list for the user, along with their values and the portfolio's total value. All this is done through server side programming on PHP. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PHP: syntax, variables, opening files, reading, writing, and appending to files, username/password validation</li>
                    <li>HTML: more work with forms, textboxes, and presenting information to the user</li>
                </ul>

            <td>
                <h3><a href="assign6/index.php">Assignment 6</a></h3>
                <p>Using a combination of MySQL and PHP, this assignment requires that a database of our choosing by added to, updated, and have records be deleted through an inteface that we design for the user. In this case, my student database allows the user to enter in relevant information, with error checking for the required fields, and insert it into the database. The page refreshes, allowing the user to see the database on the index page, which is done using a select statement to collect all records in the databse. Any record can be changed or deleted one at a time by whichever one the user selects.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SQL: syntax, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE</li>
                    <li>PHP: connecting to and using the MySQL database, creating and sending the queries to be used in the database. More work with formatting and error checking.</li>
                </ul>

            <td>
                <h3><a href="assign7/index.php">Assignment 7</a></h3>
                <p>This final project was quite smaller and much simpler compared to the last two. This asked for us to use AJAX, Javascript, and PHP to filter the information from the databse in assignment 6 and present the filtered information to the user. The information will be filtered via user input, in this case through a drop down menu containing the names of the students in the student database in assignment 6. Once a name is selected, the appropiate info from the databse of that student will be displayed for the user in a box-form to the right on the page without having to reload.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AJAX: ajaxRequest, ajax browser support via XML, readyState</li>
                </ul>
